# Expense Tracker Web Application (Kotlin Version)

## Project Overview:

Create a web-based expense tracker application using Kotlin, Spring Boot, and MSSQL database. Users can log in, add their expenses, categorize them, view spending patterns, and generate reports. This project will help you learn about back-end development, database integration, and web application deployment using Kotlin programming language.

## Key Features:

- **User Authentication:** Implement user registration and login functionality. Use Spring Security for secure authentication.

- **Expense Management:**
    - Users can add new expenses with details like amount, category, date, and description.
    - Allow users to edit and delete their expenses.

- **Categories:** Users can create different categories for their expenses (e.g., groceries, entertainment, travel).

- **Reports:**
    - Generate monthly or yearly reports showing total expenses, category-wise spending, and trends over time.
    - Implement graphical representation of data using chart libraries (like Chart.js) for visual analysis.

- **Database Integration:**
    - Use MSSQL database to store user information, expenses, and categories.
    - Utilize Spring Data JPA or Hibernate for seamless database operations.

- **RESTful API:** Create RESTful endpoints for adding, editing, deleting expenses, and retrieving reports.

- **Front-End Development:**
    - Build a responsive web interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
    - Use Thymeleaf or any other template engine to integrate front-end with Kotlin back-end.

- **GitHub Repository:**
    - Host your project on GitHub. Include clear README documentation on how to set up the project locally.
    - Make your repository public so that others can view your code and contribute if they want.

- **Testing:**
    - Write unit tests for your Kotlin classes using JUnit and Mockito to ensure code reliability.

- **Deployment:**
    - Deploy your application on platforms like Heroku, AWS, or Azure. Ensure your database is accessible from the deployed application.

## Learning Outcomes:

- **Kotlin Development:** Enhance your Kotlin programming skills by building the entire back-end logic of the application.
- **Spring Boot:** Learn to use Spring Boot for rapid application development with Kotlin.
- **Database Integration:** Understand how to connect and interact with a MSSQL database in a Kotlin application.
- **Web Development:** Gain experience in building a responsive and interactive web interface using Kotlin.
- **Version Control:** Improve your version control skills by using Git and GitHub for collaboration with Kotlin projects.
- **Problem-Solving:** Encounter and overcome challenges related to real-world application development using Kotlin.
